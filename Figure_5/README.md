### b.	Schematic of rule transition

  -- Input: AllTrials_100bin_noSmooth\ data_array.mat (processed data)\
  -- Code:  [CM_Classification_transition.m]\
  -- Notes: Trials before the first hit of a session were not included since it was no-task -> task transition not task-rule-A -> task-rule-B transition. Only transitions with rule FA were included for analysis (Rule FAs occurred before the first Hit for that block). Transitions without late period were still included (the next trial following the rule FA was Hit).
