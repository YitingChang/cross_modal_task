## Figure_6â€“figure supplement_1 Hit and false alarm rates during the inhibition of population states in the dorsal cortex. 
### a.	Schematic of inhibition within tactile stimulus trials during respond-to-touch blocks in the cross-modal selection task. 
### b.	Changes in tactile hit rate when each cortical area was optogenetically inhibited before stimulus onset. 
### c.	Changes in tactile hit rate when each cortical area was optogenetically inhibited after stimulus onset. 
### d.	Schematic of inhibition within visual stimulus trials during respond-to-touch blocks in the cross-modal selection task. 
### e.	Changes in visual false alarm rate when each cortical area was optogenetically inhibited before stimulus onset. 
### f.	Changes in visual false alarm rate when each cortical area was optogenetically inhibited after stimulus onset.
