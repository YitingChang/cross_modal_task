### a. Schematic of inhibition within visual stimulus trials during the respond-to-light blocks in the cross-modal selection task. 
### b. Changes in visual hit rate when each cortical area was optogenetically inhibited before stimulus onset. 
### c. Changes in visual hit rate when each cortical area was optogenetically inhibited after stimulus onset. 
### d. Schematic of inhibition within tactile stimulus trials during respond-to-light blocks in the cross-modal selection task. 
### e. Changes in tactile false alarm rate when each cortical area was optogenetically inhibited before stimulus onset
### f. Changes in tactile false alarm rate when each cortical area was optogenetically inhibited after stimulus onset. 
### g. Changes in detection sensitivity for visual stimuli when each cortical area was inhibited before stimulus onset. 
### h. Changes in detection sensitivity for visual stimuli when each cortical area was inhibited after stimulus onset.
