## Figure_4–figure supplement_1 Stimulus and choice coding dimensions in respond-to-touch and respond-to-light blocks.
### a.	Population activity projected on the stimulus coding dimension (CD) in respond-to-touch blocks. 
### b.     Population activity projected on the stimulus coding dimension in respond-to-light blocks. 
### c.	Population activity projected on the choice coding dimension in respond-to-touch blocks. 
### d.	Population activity projected on the choice coding dimension in respond-to-light blocks. 
  -- For a-d,\
  -- Input: cm_ephy_10msBin.mat (processed data)\
  -- Code: [CM_coding_dimension.m](CM_coding_dimension.m)
### e.	Magnitude of dot product between the stimulus CDs in respond-to-touch and respond-to-light blocks. 
### f.	Magnitude of dot product between the choice CDs in respond-to-touch and respond-to-light blocks. 
  -- For e-f,\
  -- Input: cm_ephy_10msBin.mat (processed data)\
  -- Code: [CM_coding_dimension_bootstrapping.m](CM_coding_dimension_bootstrapping.m)
### g-h.	Same as e,f but using right-lick and left-lick trials.
  -- Input: cm_ephy_10msBin.mat (processed data)\
